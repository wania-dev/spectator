           <span class="ftw">After my complete</span> 3 year annivarsary after becoming a feminist, if there is 
           one thing I've learned, it's that most Pakistanis are not feminists. That is the only thing simple about it. 
           And though in my naivety or sheer quirkiness, i must have preached or embraced the 'Future is Female' dynamic, but 
           mostly its emotional business.
        </p>
        <p>
            And no, I don't try to please anyone by saying 'Oh, I'm not a feminist' or 'Feminism is man-hating'. My opinions
            are my own and they don't even agree with my own mothers, despite her poor attempts 'to make her astray child see the right path'. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So in this post, I try to collect a mirage of opinions, beleifs, and myths about feminism and give feminists like me 
            stuck under the same dinner table with sexist aunties and uncles the tools to reason against such norms and assert their
            opinions based on hard-core facts and statistics. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It can often be frustrating when almost everyone around you patronises you how your support for the feminist movement
            can be undeserving, unworthy, unreligious, or plain non sense. Some might say that you don't know what you're talking about 
            or the beleif that women are beneath men as designated by God Himself. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Countering some of them can be difficult since the arguments made test your faith, which I know is very unfair.
